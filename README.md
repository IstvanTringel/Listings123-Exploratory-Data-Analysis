My initial project at Texas A&M University's Reynolds and Reynolds Sales Leadership Institute- Data Analytics and Agile Leadership Professional Certificate. 
In this project, I was brought on board as a business analyst at Listings123, a burgeoning home-sharing service connecting hosts and guests. The company aimed to expand to new cities through a strategic marketing campaign and needed funding from investors. I utilized Exploratory Data Analysis to identify successful host traits and gather recommendations for convincing investors of the company's potential.
